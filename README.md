## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transform & Transition
- ::selection pseudo element
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts
- [CSS Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

### What I learned

I stumbled a little with vetically aligning the box, so I searched for a solution and found the {min-height: 100vh} way and used it for the first time here:
```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development 

With building a good amount of portfolios in the past weeks I thought creating a stats card will be the easiest task, but I learned some good CSS techniques with that simple task, so I will do more of the Frontend Mentor challenges that the first one turned out to be much helpful than I thought.
